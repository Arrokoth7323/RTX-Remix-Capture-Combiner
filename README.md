# RTX-Remix-Capture-Combiner

A simple Python script using regex to merge a child capture's lights/meshes/materials/instances/cameras into a base capture. Duplicates will be accounted for and ignored.
Instances with the same ID between the base and child but different parameters will have their ID incremented until it is unique to both the base and child.

Recommended you make a backup of your base capture when exeucting this script in event of unforseen issues.
